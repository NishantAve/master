The given JavaScript code is quite complex and contains a lot of functionalities that are specific to the Node.js environment such as module imports and usage of the `process` object, which have no direct counterparts in PHP. 

However, below is a simple PHP equivalent of a small part of your JavaScript code. This PHP script below defines a few functions which are equivalent to JavaScript functions in your provided code. 

```php
<?php
    function exportVariable($name, $val) {
        putenv("$name=$val");
    }

    function addPath($inputPath) {
        $currentPath = getenv('PATH');
        putenv("PATH=$inputPath:$currentPath");
    }

    function getInput($name, $options) {
        $val = getenv("INPUT_" . strtoupper(str_replace(' ', '_', $name))) ?: '';
        if (isset($options['required']) && $options['required'] && !$val) {
            throw new Exception("Input required and not supplied: $name");
        }
        if (isset($options['trimWhitespace']) && !$options['trimWhitespace']) {
            return $val;
        }
        return trim($val);
    }

    function setOutput($name, $value) {
        echo "\n";
        echo "$name: $value\n";
    }
?>
```

Please note that this is a very basic and might not work as expected, since it doesn't cover all the functionalities of your original JavaScript code. 

A direct conversion from this JavaScript code to PHP is not feasible because both languages have different features, structures and run in different environments. Therefore, you would need to manually rewrite the functionality you need in PHP.
